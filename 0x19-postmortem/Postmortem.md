# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

## Overview

- **Duration:** January 24, 2024, 15:00 to 18:30 UTC
- **Impact:** Complete service outage affecting 80% of users
- **Root Cause:** Load balancer misconfiguration
- **Resolution:** Load balancer reconfiguration

## Issue Summary

The outage occurred on January 24, 2024, from 15:00 to 18:30 UTC. The web application experienced a complete service outage, rendering it inaccessible to users. Approximately 80% of users were affected, reporting inability to log in and access critical functionalities.

## Timeline

- **15:00 UTC:** Issue detected through a spike in error rates observed in monitoring tools.

- **15:05 UTC:** Immediate investigation initiated by the operations team.

- **15:20 UTC:** Initial assumption of a database failure was made, and database servers were checked for potential issues.

- **15:45 UTC:** Misleading path: Database servers were rebooted based on initial assumptions, causing a temporary service degradation but not resolving the root cause.

- **16:00 UTC:** Incident escalated to the database team as the focus shifted to the database layer.

- **16:30 UTC:** Database team identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing database connection failures.

- **17:00 UTC:** Misleading path: Initial focus on database queries and indexing, leading to wasted time and delays.

- **17:30 UTC:** Incident escalated to the networking team for load balancer inspection.

- **18:00 UTC:** Load balancer misconfiguration identified as the root cause, and corrective measures initiated.

- **18:30 UTC:** Service fully restored after load balancer reconfiguration.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The misconfiguration in the load balancer led to an incorrect routing of database queries, resulting in connection failures.

**Resolution:** The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration to ensure proper routing of database queries. Additionally, monitoring was improved to quickly detect and alert on similar misconfigurations.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**

1. Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations during deployment.
2. Enhance monitoring alerts for load balancer performance and misconfigurations.
3. Conduct a thorough review of all critical configurations to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Tasks:**

1. Develop and implement automated tests for load balancer configurations - ETA: 2 weeks.
2. Enhance monitoring system to include load balancer health checks - ETA: 1 week.
3. Conduct a comprehensive review of critical system configurations - ETA: 3 weeks.

This incident highlighted the importance of regularly auditing configurations and the need for automated testing to catch misconfigurations before they impact the production environment. The corrective measures aim to prevent similar issues in the future and improve the overall resilience of the web stack.
