# Web Stack Debugging Project

This project aims to debug and optimize the web server setup featuring Nginx to handle the load generated by ApacheBench effectively.

## Project Overview

- **Task**: Debug and optimize Nginx configuration to minimize failed requests during ApacheBench benchmarking.
- **Started**: January 22, 2024
- **Deadline**: January 28, 2024

## Project Requirements

- All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
- All files end with a new line.
- Puppet manifests must pass `puppet-lint` version 2.1.1 without any errors.
- Puppet manifests must run without errors.
- Puppet manifests must be properly commented.
- Puppet manifest files must end with the extension `.pp`.
- Files will be checked with Puppet v3.4.

## Task Details

The issue observed during benchmarking with ApacheBench:
- 943 failed requests out of 2000 requests sent.

## Solution Approach

- Identified potential issues within the Nginx configuration.
- Utilized Puppet manifest to modify Nginx settings and optimize its performance.
- Applied iterative testing and adjustment to ensure effective resolution of failed requests issue.

## Puppet Manifest (`0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp`)

- Configures Nginx settings to enhance performance under load.
- Ensures compliance with project requirements.

## Benchmarking Results

- Before Optimization:
  - Failed requests: 943
- After Optimization:
  - Failed requests: 0

## Conclusion

The optimized Nginx configuration successfully mitigated the issue of failed requests during ApacheBench benchmarking. Further monitoring and testing may be required to ensure sustained performance.
